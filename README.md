A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers. It forwards client requests to the appropriate backend server and then sends the response back to the client.
Why Use a Reverse Proxy?
1. Load Balancing – Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
2. SSL Termination – Handles HTTPS encryption/decryption to offload SSL processing from backend servers.
3. Caching – Improves performance by caching static content and reducing server load.
